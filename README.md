# Voting System

This project implements a simple digital voting system in Python. It serves as a foundational prototype that can be extended to include secure voting protocols, cryptographic verification, and real-time result aggregation.

## 🗳️ Features

- Candidate registration
- Voter registration
- Voting process with user validation
- Result tallying and display
- Modular design with `core/` logic separation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies

### Running the App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghavendraRQ/VotingSystem.git
cd VotingSystem
python main.py
```

├── main.py        # Entry point
└── .github/       # GitHub workflow (CI/CD placeholder)
```

## 🛡️ Future Enhancements

- Add cryptographic authentication (e.g., public key signatures)
- Implement a database backend
- Web-based interface with Flask or FastAPI
- Add automated test suite with `pytest`
